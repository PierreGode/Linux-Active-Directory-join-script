============

Contributions are welcome!

**Please carefully read this page to make the code review process go as smoothly as possible and to maximize the likelihood of your contribution being merged.**

## Bug Reports

For bug reports or requests [submit an issue](https://github.com/PierreGode/Linux-Active-Directory-join-script/issues).

## Pull Requests

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/PierreGode/Linux-Active-Directory-join-script) on GitHub.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/PierreGode/Linux-Active-Directory-join-script).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/Linux-Active-Directory-join-script
        $ cd system-design-primer

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. Don't work in the `master` branch!

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `Linux-Active-Directory-join-script` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.
